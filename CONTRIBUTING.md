## Coding Standards

### Solidity

- Follow Solidity style guide
- Use NatSpec comments for all public functions
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add appropriate access modifiers
- Include comprehensive error messages

Example:
```solidity
/**
 * @notice Register a new institution
 * @param pubkey The institution's public key address
 * @param name The institution name
 * @return institutionId The assigned institution ID
 */
function registerInstitution(
    address pubkey,
    string memory name
) external onlyRole(REGISTRAR_ROLE) returns (uint256) {
    require(pubkey != address(0), "Invalid pubkey");
    // Implementation
}
```

### JavaScript/TypeScript

- Use ES6+ features
- Follow ESLint configuration
- Add JSDoc comments for functions
- Use async/await over callbacks
- Handle errors appropriately

### Testing

- Write tests for all new features
- Aim for high test coverage
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and failure cases
- Include edge cases

Example:
```javascript
describe("Feature", function () {
  it("Should perform expected behavior", async function () {
    // Test implementation
  });

  it("Should fail with invalid input", async function () {
    await expect(contract.function()).to.be.revertedWith("Error message");
  });
});
```

## Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Adolph-Hughes/AstralSeed.git
   cd AstralSeed
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Copy environment file**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. **Run tests**
   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```

5. **Compile contracts**
   ```bash
   npm run compile
   ```

## Security

### Reporting Security Issues

**DO NOT** create public issues for security vulnerabilities. Instead:
- Email security concerns to the maintainers
- Provide detailed description and reproduction steps
- Allow time for fixes before public disclosure

### Security Best Practices

- Never commit private keys or secrets
- Use `.env` for sensitive configuration
- Review code carefully before committing
- Run security analysis tools
- Follow smart contract security best practices

## Questions?

If you have questions:
- Check existing issues and discussions
- Review the documentation
- Create a new issue with the "question" label
